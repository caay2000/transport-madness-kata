## Summary

Like in transport tycoon game, we want to have multiple "companies" playing our simulation, each one with its own
routes, vehicles and anything a company needs. So to start with it, we want that each company has its own connections
and entities, and won't be able to use connections from other companies.

For this first iteration, we don't want that the same cell has connections from different companies, but cities. So only
cities can be connected by multiple companies!

Let's do it!
